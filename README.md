# ASR-RECOGNITION-IN-NOISY-CONDITIONS
Evaluated the Wav2Vec2.0 speech recognition model in noisy acoustic environments. Applied three noise-reduction methods (low-pass filtering, spectral gating, noisereduce) and measured performance using WER, CER, and SNR. Results show clear accuracy improvements when using audio preprocessing.
